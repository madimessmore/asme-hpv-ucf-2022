Some interesting points to note, are that if we want to design the most aerodynamic fairing possible then we have two approaches. 
Either attempt to perfectly shape it so thatairflow is perfectly laminar around it, or we optimize around the inevitability of turbulence. 
The main things to look at are aspect ratio, curvature, and length. These are all factors that are intertwined and directly impact each other,
so optimization shouldn't be as challenging. As we move forward and develop more of the design, these parameters can be fleshed out further.
